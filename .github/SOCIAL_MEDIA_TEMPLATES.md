### Technical Deep Dive
```
🔍 Technical highlight: Laravel Persian Validation implements dual validation approaches:

1️⃣ Modern ValidationRule objects (Laravel 10+)
2️⃣ Traditional string-based rules (backward compatibility)

This design choice ensures:
✅ Future-proof development
✅ Smooth migration path
✅ IDE support and type safety
✅ Performance optimization

Example:
// Modern
['mobile' => [new Mobile()]]

// Traditional  
['mobile' => ['ir_mobile']]

Both approaches work seamlessly together.
